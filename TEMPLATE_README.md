# üìù Template Files Ready for Your Implementation

I've created clean template files for you to fill with your notebook functions. Here's what each file is for:

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. `data_processing.py`

**Based on Notebook 02 - Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- `ZomatoDataProcessor` class with methods for:
  - Loading raw data
  - Standardizing column names
  - Cleaning text and fixing encoding issues
  - Processing rate/rating columns
  - Handling missing values
  - Detecting outliers
  - Data quality validation

### 2. `geo_features.py`

**Based on Notebook 04 - Geolocation Analysis**

- `ZomatoGeoFeatureEngineer` class with methods for:
  - Extracting coordinates from location strings
  - Parsing location components
  - Calculating distance features
  - Creating location clusters
  - Extracting area statistics

### 3. `nlp_features.py`

**Based on Notebook 05 - NLP Feature Engineering**

- `ZomatoNLPFeatureEngineer` class with methods for:
  - Text preprocessing
  - Sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob, Transformers)
  - Restaurant name analysis
  - Cuisine text processing
  - Text complexity features
  - Text embeddings

### 4. `modeling.py`

**Based on Notebook 06 - Modeling & Evaluation**

- `ZomatoModelTrainer` class with methods for:
  - Training XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost models
  - Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
  - Model evaluation
  - Feature importance analysis
  - MLflow integration

### 5. `prediction_service.py`

**New - Combines Everything for Production**

- `ZomatoPredictionService` class that:
  - Integrates all processing pipelines
  - Loads trained models
  - Makes predictions
  - Handles validation

### 6. `config.py` (Updated)

**Configuration and Settings**

- Paths, model parameters, API settings
- **TODO**: Update with your actual values from notebooks

## üéØ Your Task

1. **Copy Functions**: Extract key functions from your notebooks into these files
2. **Follow the Structure**: Each file has placeholder methods - fill them with your code
3. **Keep the Class Structure**: The classes are designed to work together
4. **Update TODOs**: Replace all `# YOUR CODE HERE` with your notebook logic
5. **Update Config**: Fill in actual parameters from your best model results

## üöÄ After You Fill The Files

Once you've implemented the functions:

1. I'll review and optimize the code
2. Fix any integration issues
3. Test the complete pipeline
4. Get the API working end-to-end

## üí° Tips

- **Start with `data_processing.py`** - this is the foundation
- **Keep the method signatures** - don't change the function names/parameters
- **Use your notebook logic** - copy the working code from your analysis
- **Test as you go** - each method should work independently
- **Ask for help** - if you need clarification on any structure

## üìã Priority Order

1. **`data_processing.py`** ‚Üí Core data cleaning from notebook 02
2. **`geo_features.py`** ‚Üí Location features from notebook 04
3. **`nlp_features.py`** ‚Üí Text features from notebook 05
4. **`prediction_service.py`** ‚Üí Update with your feature columns
5. **`config.py`** ‚Üí Update with your best model parameters

**Good luck with your AI-102 exam! When you're ready, start filling these files and we'll get your production system working! üöÄ**
